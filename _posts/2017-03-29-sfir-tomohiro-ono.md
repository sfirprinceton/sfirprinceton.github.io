Recent observations have revealed protoplanetary disks with lopsided 
structures. A formation theory of those structures suggests the 
presence of gas vortexes induced by the Rossby wave instability (RWI). 
When a disk has a rapid radial variation, gas vortexes are formed by 
the RWI. In order to understand how vortexes are formed, we perform 
linear stability analyses and numerical simulations using the Atehna++ 
code on a large parameter space. I will present the property and the 
evolution of the vortex. This study may help extract the physical 
property of the disks from observations of lopsided disks.
