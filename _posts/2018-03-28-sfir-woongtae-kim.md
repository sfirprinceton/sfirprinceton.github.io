Barred-spiral galaxies, abound with rings and spirals in the nuclear 
regions. Nuclear rings exhibit star formation at a rate varying widely 
in the range of 0.1-10 Msun per year. Some rings have an age gradient 
of star clusters along the azimuthal direction, while others do not. 
Nuclear spirals existing even in weakly barred galaxies are thought to 
channel gas inflows to supermassive black holes residing at the 
centers. We use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to study the 
formation of nuclear rings and spirals in barred galaxies. We show that 
the ring star formation rates depend on the mass inflow rates driven by 
the bar potential. Rings without an azimuthal age gradient found to be 
gravitationally unstable. We also show that nuclear spirals become 
nonlinear and shocked even for a very weak potential due to a geometric 
effect. The shape of the spirals and shocks depends rather sensitively 
on the background shear. The induced mass inflow rates are enough to 
power black hole accretion in various types of Seyfert galaxies.
