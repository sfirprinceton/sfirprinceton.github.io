Supernovae (SN) feedback is considered to play a key role in galaxy 
formation, by regulating star formation and launching outflows. Yet how 
it works is poorly understood. In my thesis, I use high-resolution, 3D 
hydrodynamic simulations to study how multiple SN shape the multiphase 
ISM, and how they launch galactic outflows. I will discuss how the ISM 
properties, such as gas pressure, volume fraction of different phases, 
change over a wide range of gas densities and SN rates. For SN-driven 
outflows, I will focus on how much energy/mass/metals are launched from 
galaxy disks, and how these change with star formation rate. I will 
briefly talk about comparing the warm-hot component in my simulations 
with the observations, as traced by OVI.
