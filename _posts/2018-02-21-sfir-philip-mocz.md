Star formation in our Galaxy occurs in molecular clouds that are 
self-gravitating, highly turbulent, and magnetized. We study the 
conditions out of which collapse of pre-stellar cores occurs in such an 
environment, and how collapse proceeds from parsec to AU scale, as a 
function of mean magnetic field strength characterized by the Alfvenic 
Mach number of the mean-field M_A0. Supersonic isothermal turbulence 
creates a network of dense shocks with M_s^2 density jumps and 
exponential atmospheres balancing the ram-pressure of material being 
swept up. These rare and dense regions of a turbulent medium can be 
Jeans unstable and collapse into cores. There are two regimes of 
collapse based on whether the turbulent kinetic energy density 
dominates over the magnetic pressure of the mean-field (M_A0>1) or 
vice-versa (M_A0<1). In the weak-field case (M_A0>1), shocks are 
randomly oriented with respect to the mean field and collapse is 
approximately isotropic with B~rho^{2/3}, and core properties are 
similar regardless of initial mean-field strength. In the case of 
strong magnetic field (M_A0<1), dense structures are initially parallel 
to the magnetic field lines and collapse is anisotropic with 
B~rho^{1/2}, and fast turbulent reconnection diffusion is critical to 
remove magnetic flux and allow collapse. Magnetic field topology as a 
function of length scale can be used to recover key physical parameters 
of turbulence in the interstellar medium.
