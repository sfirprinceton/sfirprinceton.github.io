Solar prominences are long-lived cool and dense plasma curtains in the 
hot and rarefied corona. The physical mechanism responsible for their 
formation and especially for their internal plasma circulation has been 
uncertain for decades. The observed ubiquitous down flows in quiescent 
prominences are difficult to interpret as plasma with high conductivity 
seems to move across horizontal magnetic field lines. Here we present 
three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of prominence formation 
and evolution in an elongated  magnetic flux rope as a result of 
in-situ plasma condensations fueled by continuous plasma evaporation 
from the solar chromosphere. The prominence is born and maintained in a 
fragmented, highly dynamic state with continuous reappearance of 
multiple blobs and thread structures that move mainly downward dragging 
along mass-loaded field lines. The prominence plasma circulation is 
characterized by the dynamic balance between the drainage of prominence 
plasma back to the chromosphere and the formation of prominence plasma 
via continuous condensation. Plasma evaporates from the  chromosphere, 
condenses into the prominence in the corona, and drains back to the 
chromosphere, establishing a stable chromosphere-corona plasma cycle. 
Another form of cool and dense plasma in the corona is coronal rain, 
which forms through similar mechanism in-situ and drain down arched 
pathways along loops near active regions. We present 3D simulations of 
coronal rain in a bipolar arcade with preliminary results.
