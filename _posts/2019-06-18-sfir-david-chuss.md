Far-Infrared polarimetry is a useful tool for exploring the role of 
magnetic fields in star formation and Galactic dynamics. The HAWC+/SOFIA 
polarimeter provides a major leap forward in observing capability from 
previous FIR polarimeters by providing both photometric and polarimetric 
imaging at 53, 89, 154, and 214 microns. I will review the instrumental 
capabilities and discuss initial results from HAWC+, including 
multiwavelength measurements of the OMC-1 region.
