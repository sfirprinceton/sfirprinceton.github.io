Supernovae (SNe) drive metal-enriched, galaxy-wide outflows. How the 
outflows impact the circumgalactic medium (CGM) depends on (a) how much 
mass/energy/metals the outflows carry, and (b) what is already in the 
CGM. Small-box, high-resolution simulations on SNe feedback constrain 
(a) but leave out (b), whereas cosmological simulations capture (b) but 
use ad hoc models for (a).  We aim at bridging the gap by adopting 
small-box results as the outflow model for galaxy-scale simulations to 
study the resultant CGM. In this talk, I will first summarize the 
recent progress of small-box simulations; particularly, the hot 
outflows appear to be simple yet powerful. Using a Milky Way-mass 
galaxy for an example, we find that, when the star formation surface 
density is low, hot outflows form large-scale fountains in the halo. 
The warm-hot CGM has a universal density profile, which produces the 
observed column density of O VI, VII, and VIII, and X-ray emission. 
Cool gas that condenses out of the hot CGM is highly enriched and 
mainly falls toward the galaxy. In contrast, when the star formation 
surface density is high, the outflows are bipolar in shape and funnel 
metals into the intergalactic medium; cool gas is moderately-enriched, 
with a fraction moving outward at high velocities.
