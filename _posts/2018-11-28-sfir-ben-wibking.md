Popular models used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of 
galaxy formation have invoked direct radiation pressure on dust as a 
critical component of stellar feedback. I investigate the stability 
properties of direct radiation pressure on dust due to young stellar 
populations within starburst disk galaxies and compute observational 
estimates of galaxy-averaged Eddington ratios. I assess the prospects 
for radiation pressure-driven galactic winds and 
radiation-pressure-driven galactic turbulence and conclude with future 
directions for study of the dynamics of dust, gas, and radiation in 
galaxies.
