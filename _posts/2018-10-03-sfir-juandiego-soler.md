The broad range of scales, the diversity of physical conditions, and the
large volumes of observed and simulated data make understanding of the
dynamical behavior of the interstellar medium (ISM) a big-data problem.
I will present two examples of how some techniques borrowed from machine
vision can improve our understanding of the molecular cloud formation
process: first, in the comparison of the column density structure and
the magnetic field morphology inferred of dust polarized emission
observations and, second, in the systematic characterization of spectral
line observations of atomic and molecular gas.
