Rotating disks and supersonic jets are seen associated with central 
protostars in the early phase of star formation. However, it is still 
uncertain when and how such disks and jets can be formed. Their 
formation process is believed to be complicated by the presence of 
magnetic field. To unveil their formation process, we have observed a 
few young nearby protostellar systems, with Submillimeter Array (SMA) 
and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We find that 
our results are roughly consistent with current theoretical models of 
disk and jet formation. In this talk, I will present some of our 
results for discussions.
