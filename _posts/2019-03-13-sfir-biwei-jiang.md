Based on the color indices from the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the 
stellar parameters from the SDSSâ€“DR12/APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic 
surveys, the near-infrared extinction law of and the distance to the 
Monoceros SNR are derived together with those of the two nebulae close 
to it, the Rosette Nebula and NGC2264. The distance is found at the 
position of the sharp increase of the interstellar extinction with 
distance, and the nebular extinction is calculated by subtracting the 
foreground interstellar extinction. The distance to the Monoceros SNR 
is determined to be 1.98 kpc, larger than previous values. The color 
excess ratio, EJH/EJKS, is 0.657 for the Monoceros SNR, consistent with 
the average value of 0.652 for the Milky Way. This consistency results 
from the fact that the SNR material is dominated by interstellar dust 
rather than by the supernova ejecta. The dust mass of the SNR is 
estimated as well. The preliminary results on the extinction law of 20 
SNRs will be presented as well.
