CO is a widely used observational tracer for molecular clouds in 
galaxies. Because CO line emission is usually optically thick, the mass 
of molecular clouds is often calculated using the empirical X_CO 
conversion factor. However, the X_CO factor is not constant throughout 
the galaxy, and it is important to understand its dependence on the 
environment. We present a detailed study of the X_CO conversion factor 
in realistic galactic disk simulations. We show that the X_CO factor is 
independent of the simulation resolution for resolution below 2 pc. We 
compare the properties of molecular clouds from our simulations to 
observations, and show that we can reproduce the basic properties of CO 
emission, such as the dependence of X_CO on gas surface density. We 
find that 20-80% of the molecular gas is not traced by CO emission.
