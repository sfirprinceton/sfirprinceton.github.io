To understand the formation, evolution, and planetary outcomes of the 
disks around young stars, it is important to know the amount and 
distribution of material within them. Millimeter continuum observations 
reveal the solid component and the conventional wisdom has been to 
estimate disk mases by multiplying by an ISM gas-to-dust ratio of 100. 
However, spectral line data that quantify the gas content independently 
show a puzzling discrepancy. I will present recent ALMA observations 
that suggest the gas dissipates faster than the dust. Iâ€™ll speculate on 
possible explanations and implications, in particular for the 
prevalence of super-Earths and Neptunes over Jupiters in the exoplanet 
population.
