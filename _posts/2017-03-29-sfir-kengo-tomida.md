We study formation and long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk 
using a resistive MHD simulation. While the circumstellar disk is 
initially small, it grows up to 200 AUs as accretion continues. A pair 
of grand-design spiral arms form recurrently due to gravitational 
instability throughout the Class-0/I phase, and they transfer angular 
momentum efficiently. We compare our model with Elias 2-27 using the 
synthetic observation technique and find good agreement between our 
model and the observation. If such spiral arms commonly exist in young 
circumstellar disks, it implies that young circumstellar disks are 
considerably massive and gravitational instability is the key process 
of angular momentum transport.
