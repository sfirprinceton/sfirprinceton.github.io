Observed star-forming galaxies convert their gas into stars 
inefficiently. The typical time on which available gas in galaxies is 
depleted is ~2-10 Gyr which is orders of magnitude longer than any 
physical timescale relevant for star formation. The origin of long 
depletion times is a long-standing puzzle. Many galaxy simulations can 
reproduce observed long depletion times but the physical mechanism 
controlling their values is not understood in detail. In addition, some 
of the simulations show rather counter-intuitive behavior: global 
depletion times appear to be almost insensitive to the assumptions 
about local star formation in individual star-forming regions, a 
phenomenon described as “self-regulation.” Yet another part of the 
puzzle is the observed tight and near-linear correlation between star 
formation rates and the amount of molecular gas on kiloparsec and 
larger scales. A linear correlation implies that depletion time of 
molecular gas is almost independent of molecular gas density on 
>kiloparsec scales, while popular models of star formation in galaxies 
predict a strong dependence. I will present results from a suite of 
isolated disk galaxy simulations in which we systematically explored 
the behavior of depletion times. Using insights from these simulations 
we formulated a physical model that explains both the origin of long 
gas depletion times in observed galaxies and the results of galaxy 
formation simulations. This model also sheds light on the origin of the 
observed linear correlation between star formation rates and molecular 
gas.
