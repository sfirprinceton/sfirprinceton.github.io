Energetic feedback from massive stars plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamical evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). In this talk, I will present a suite of isolated GMC simulations to investigate how stellar feedback affects the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the subsequent dynamical response of embedded star clusters. We find that the SFE of the clouds scales strongly with the initial cloud surface density and momentum feedback strength. The boundness of the resulting star clusters is a continuously increasing function of SFE. GMCs with efficiency much smaller than 0.5 are still able to form clusters with large bound fractions. The initial density profile of clouds, though has little effect on the SFE, controls the mode of star formation. Clouds with shallower profiles form stars bottom-up, while highly-concentrated clouds form massive star clusters at the center, which gradually accrete mass from the cloud outskirt later. In the end, I will briefly talk about our preliminary results on how dust dynamics enhance the effects of ionizing radiation from massive stars.
