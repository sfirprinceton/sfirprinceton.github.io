Most star formation in the local Universe occurs in a clustered 
configuration, however the fraction of stars that are born in 
long-lived, gravitationally-bound clusters appears to vary with 
galactic environment. Since feedback from massive stars is the main 
obstacle to the formation of massive, self-gravitating clusters, its 
ability to unbind clusters must thus have some environmental 
dependence. Using a suite of MHD star cluster formation simulations 
with stellar feedback, we survey a wide range of ISM conditions and 
predict a scaling in the efficiency of bound cluster formation that is 
consistent with observations in the local Universe. This model is 
largely consistent with previous analytic predictions, but requires far 
fewer parameters and assumptions. We thus derive new physical insights 
about the role of stellar feedback in star cluster formation. The 
simulations motivate a new model that predicts detailed cluster 
population statistics from the ISM properties in a galaxy. By coupling 
this model to cosmological simulations, we approach the problem of the 
cosmological origins of globular clusters, and generate a catalogue of 
cluster initial conditions for detailed dynamical studies.
