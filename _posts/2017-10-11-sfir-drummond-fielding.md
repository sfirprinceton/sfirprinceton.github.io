The flow of gas through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) regulates 
galaxy growth over cosmic time. Observations have recently revealed a 
complex multi-phase structure in the CGM that has challenged many of 
the established theories and highlights significant gaps in our 
understanding of this critical aspect of galaxy formation. The spatial 
scales relevant to the CGM span a huge range with its structure and 
evolution determined by small-scale processes—such as the launching of 
galactic winds by clustered supernovae and thermal instability in the 
hydrostatic halo—and large-scale processes—such as cosmological 
accretion. I will describe my efforts to understand the details and 
interplay of these multi-scale processes in order to develop a coherent 
picture of the CGM that is consistent with observations.
