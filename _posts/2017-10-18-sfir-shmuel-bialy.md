Star formation occurs in the cold molecular phase of the Interstellar 
Medium (ISM). In turn, stellar winds and outflows, UV radiation, and 
supernovae control the thermal and chemical structure of the ISM and 
inject turbulence into the gas. In this talk, I will review several 
problems, all related to various phases of the ISM.
 
1) the Molecular gas: I will discuss the chemical structure of 
UV-shielded dense clouds, comparing Galactic environment to those in 
the Early Universe, at the epoch of first metal enrichment. These low 
metallicity clouds are expected to be CO poor (dominated by atomic C) 
with the dominant heavy molecule being OH or H2O. A similar chemical 
structure may is obtained also in normal metallicity clouds if the 
cosmic-ray/X-ray ionization rate to density ratio is large.

2) the Atomic-to-molecular transition: I will discuss the HI-to-H2 
transition and the important role of supersonic turbulence in producing 
strong density fluctuations. As I will show, our theory combined with 
21 cm observations, may be used to constrain the turbulence driving 
scale in the atomic gas.

3) the global atomic ISM: I will present preliminary results for the 
thermal structure of the atomic ISM as a function of metallicity and UV 
intensity, and taking into account H2 heating and cooling. We find that 
when the metallicity becomes low, the ISM loses its two-phased nature 
(cold/warm neutral media; CNM/WNM), and the phase diagram is 
characterized by a monotonically increasing pressure-density curve.
