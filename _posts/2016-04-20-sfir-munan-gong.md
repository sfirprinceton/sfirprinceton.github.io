Chemistry plays an important role in the interstellar medium (ISM), 
regulating heating and cooling of the gas, and determining abundances 
of molecular species that trace gas properties in observations. 
Although solving the time-dependent equations is necessary for accurate 
abundances and temperature in the dynamic ISM, a full chemical network 
is too computationally expensive to incorporate in numerical 
simulations. In this paper, we propose a new simplified chemical 
network for hydrogen and carbon chemistry in the atomic and molecular 
ISM. We show that our chemical network gives similar results to a full 
photo-dissociation region (PDR) code PDR code in the equilibrium 
abundances of all species over a wide range of densities. Applying our 
network in1D models, we find that the CO-dominated regime delimits the 
coldest gas and that the corresponding temperature tracks the cosmic 
ray ionization rate in molecular clouds. We provide a simple fit for 
the locus of CO dominated regions as a function of gas density and 
column. We also construct a simple model to calculate the composition 
of turbulent molecular clouds in slab and spherical geometry, and 
compare that with observations.
