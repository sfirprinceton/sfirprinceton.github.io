We present the first cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh 
code AREPO to study the evolution of dust and metals within galaxies.  
These simulations enable us to track the lifecycle of dust, including 
production in stars, evolution in the interstellar medium, and 
transport via galactic winds.  Using both zoom-in and full-volume 
cosmological runs, we analyze the dust formation history of individual 
galaxies and predict the dust mass function at a variety of redshifts, 
finding agreement with observed values.  We investigate several scaling 
relations tying dust mass to star formation that can help observers 
estimate dust masses, and we demonstrate for the first time the impact 
of dust on the thermodynamic state of galaxy clusters.  To study dust 
dynamics in the ISM, we present new work to track the drag force 
coupling dust grains to hydrodynamic motion and implement a novel model 
to self-consistently evolve the dust grain size distribution on the fly 
in cosmological simulations.  This work will explore how various 
galactic processes shape the interstellar grain size distribution and 
allow more accurate creation of synthetic galaxy extinction curves.  
These methods will enable cosmological simulations to more 
realistically treat dust extinction in generating mock galaxy images.
