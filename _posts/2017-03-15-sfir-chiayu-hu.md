Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous type of galaxy in the local 
Universe. They tend to have low metallicity and low dust-to-gas ratio 
compared to spiral galaxies. Understanding the interstellar medium in 
dwarf galaxies may provide crucial insights on the high-redshift 
galaxies that have comparable metallicity. In this talk, I will show 
the recent results from high-resolution numerical simulations of 
isolated dwarf galaxies, which can start to resolve the cold gas and 
stellar feedback on galactic scales. In particular, I will focus on the 
formation of molecular hydrogen and its (non-)correlation with star 
formation, which has important implications to the sub-grid recipes 
widely adopted in many large-scale cosmological simulations. I will 
also discuss the interplay of different types of stellar feedback that 
shapes the interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies, where the gas is 
driven far out of thermal- and chemical-equilibrium. Finally, I will 
demonstrate how the galactic outflows are controlled by the number of 
supernovae that occur in low-density environments.
