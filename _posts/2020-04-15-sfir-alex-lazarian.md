Due to the advances in understanding of MHD turbulence and turbulent reconnection we
formulated a new Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) of magnetic field tracing. The technique
has been successfully tested using high resolution numerical simulations as well as by
comparing with magnetic field maps obtained with the with Planck satellite and BLASTPOL
polarimetry. In my talk I am going to focus on new prospects that the VGT presents in terms of
exploring (a) the 3D structure of magnetic fields in molecular clouds, (b) the magnetic
connection of dense and diffuse gas and (c) the dynamics of the gravitational collapse. The
latter possibility is illustrated, on the basis of numerical simulations, in Figure 1. There it is
shown that how to identify using the VGT the regions of gravitational collapse as well as to
trace magnetic field. I will show of survey of nearby molecular clouds where both magnetic
fields and regions of gravitational collapse are identified using the VGT. In addition, I shall show
the 3D magnetic structure of Vela C molecular cloud that is obtained by applying the VGT to
different molecular species that are formed at different optical depths. Finally, I shall describe a
new technique that demonstrates high precision in obtaining the strength of magnetic fields
using the VGT. Using numerical data, I will demonstrate that the new technique can provide the
magnetic field strength in the regions strongly affected by self-gravity where the classical DavisChandrasekhar-Fermi technique fails. I will show the results for magnetic field strength
obtained for nearby molecular clouds.
