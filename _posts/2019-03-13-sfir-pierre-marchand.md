The Hall effect is one of the three processes of non-ideal MHD that 
decouple the magnetic field from the gas. By converting poloidal 
magnetic field in toroidal magnetic field, it is especially important 
in star formation because it can either strengthen or weaken the 
magnetic braking, thus influencing the properties of the circumstellar 
disk. I will present my implementation of the Hall effect in the AMR 
code RAMSES, as well as the difficulties we encountered concerning the 
conservation of angular momentum.
