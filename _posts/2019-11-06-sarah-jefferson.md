The giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifetime places an upper bound on the local time-scale for star-formation, linking cloud- and sub cloud-scale physics to galaxy-scale trends in the star formation rate. Recent observations reveal environmentally-driven trends in GMC properties (e.g. surface densities, velocity dispersions, and turbulent pressures), demanding a systematic, predictive theory of the GMC lifecycle across the parameter space of observable star-forming environments. I will present an analytic theory for GMC lifetimes set by the galactic-dynamical time-scales of the interstellar medium, dependent on just three sets of observables: the rotation curve, surface densities and velocity dispersions of the host galaxy. I will compare and contrast these predictions with a statistical sample of simulated GMCs across three isolated disc galaxies, modelled using the hydrodynamical, moving-mesh code Arepo. My simulations incorporate the features required to accurately model star formation and the influence of stellar feedback on the ISM, including ISM chemistry, a stochastic treatment of star formation, mechanical supernova feedback, and pre-supernova feedback from HII regions. As such, I will (1) examine the nature of the relationship between key GMC properties and the galactic-dynamic environment, and (2) investigate the influence of star formation feedback in truncating the GMC lifetime, relative to the dynamical prediction of the analytic theory. I will also present a comparison of my theoretical results to pioneering observational data currently obtained with ALMA. Together, this combination of analytic, numerical and observational results show that the galactic dynamic environment plays a crucial role in determining GMC lifecycles and thus the star formation rates of their host galaxies.
