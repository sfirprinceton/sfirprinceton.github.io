Dust traps in “transition” discs have long thought to be prime sites 
for planet formation. Here I will discuss some of the implications of 
rapid low-mass planet formation by pebble accretion in a dust trap. For 
parameters similar to those seen in the most massive (and therefore 
brightness and best imaged) transition discs I will show that the 
thermal feedback from rapid accretion onto a planet can lead to the 
formation of large scale disc structure. Such structure maybe 
indicative of non asymmetric features recently observationally found in 
these discs.
