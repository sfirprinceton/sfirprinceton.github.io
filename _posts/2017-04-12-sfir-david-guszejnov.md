Turbulence is thought to be a primary driving force behind the early 
stages of star formation as large, self-gravitating, turbulent clouds 
fragment into smaller clouds which in turn fragment into even smaller 
ones. Following this cascade from GMC to stellar scales is extremely 
challenging numerically. In this talk I will introduce the MISFIT 
semi-analytic framework that can follow this process with minimal 
computational costs. Because of its simplicity MISFIT is ideal for 
theoretical experimentation to explore what are the principal processes 
behind the different aspects of star formation (e.g. what sets the IMF 
peak? what sets the stellar correlation?).
