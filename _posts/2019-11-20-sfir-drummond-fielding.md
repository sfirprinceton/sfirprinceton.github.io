The flow of gas into and out of galaxies regulates their evolution over cosmic time. The dynamics of these multiphase flows are sensitive to the small scale processes that mediate the mixing of the hot and cold phases. I will highlight two examples where this is mixing is acutely important: (i) the launching of galactic winds by supernova powered superbubbles, and (ii) the balance of turbulent heating and radiative cooling that determines galactic accretion. Then, based on a suite of high resolution simulations, I will present a new model based on the fractal nature of radiative turbulent mixing layers that fully characterizes the physical processes that control the multiphase mixing.
