The extragalactic background light (EBL) provides a summary statistic 
of cosmological galaxy formation and encodes information from all 
relevant physics in a light-weighted manner. However, one needs to 
resolve key spectral features in the EBL in order to extract the 
physics. For this, we developed a cross-correlation based tomographic 
method to recover previously lost redshift and sub-bandpass frequency 
information for the diffuse light in classic wide-field, broadband 
imaging surveys. I will show the first application with data by probing 
the continuum, LyÎ± line, and Lyman break in the cosmic UV background 
(UVB) up to z~2 using GALEX All Sky and Medium Imaging Surveys. These 
empirically constrained UVB spectral features provide insights on the 
cosmic star formation history, the absorption due to neutral gas in the 
interstellar medium, and the potential emission from the diffuse 
intergalactic medium. We expect this method to be generically 
applicable over a wide range of wavebands, with a potential of 
performing various spectral diagnostics over the panchromatic EBL.
