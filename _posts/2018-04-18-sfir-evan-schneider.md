Cool (T~10^4 K) gas is ubiquitous near star-forming galaxies, both in 
outflows and in their surrounding circumgalactic media. Observations 
have demonstrated the presence of this gas in halos via absorption in 
quasar sight-lines, as well as in outflows through “down-the-barrel” 
absorption-line studies wherein the galaxy itself serves as the 
background source. Despite its prevalence, the physical origin of the 
cool gas found in these systems remains a topic of debate. In this 
talk, I will discuss the possibility of mass-loaded hot winds as a 
source of cool gas that is found around galaxies. Through a series of 
high-resolution simulations, I demonstrate that in high star formation 
surface density systems, moderate mass-loading (of order half the star 
formation rate) at small radii leads to large-scale cooling flows that 
can transport cool gas out into a galaxy’s halo. Anisotropic spatial 
distribution of the outflowing gas produces results that are in good 
agreement with soft X-ray observations of nearby starburst galaxies. 
This production mechanism is particularly attractive because it allows 
cool gas in outflows to survive over time-scales long enough to explain 
its presence at large observed radii and velocities.
