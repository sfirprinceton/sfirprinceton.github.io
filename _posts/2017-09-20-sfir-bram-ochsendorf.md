Galaxy-wide surveys allow to study star formation in unprecedented 
ways. In this talk, I will discuss our analysis of the Large Magellanic 
Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way, and illustrate how studying both the 
large and small scale structure of galaxies are critical in addressing 
the question: what drives the formation of massive stars and clusters?

I will show that ‘turbulence-regulated’ star formation models do not 
reproduce massive star formation properties of GMCs in the LMC and 
Milky Way: this suggests that theory currently does not capture the 
full complexity of star formation on small  scales. I will also report 
on the discovery of a massive star forming complex in the LMC, which in 
many ways manifests itself as an embedded twin of 30 Doradus: this may 
shed light on the formation of R136 and 'Super Star Clusters' in 
general. Finally, I will highlight what we can expect in the next years 
in the field of star formation with ALMA, JWST, and large-scale sky 
surveys.
