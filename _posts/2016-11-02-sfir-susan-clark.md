I will present unique approaches to two open problems in magnetized 
plasmas: the search for inflationary gravitational wave B-mode 
polarization in the CMB, and the saturation mechanism of the 
magnetorotational instability (MRI). B-mode detection would be the 
first direct evidence of inflation, but is currently limited by the 
Galactic polarized dust foreground. I will describe how magnetically 
aligned neutral hydrogen structures in the interstellar medium can 
constrain this foreground. The second open problem I investigate deals 
with saturation, which is key to the MRIâ€™s role as a driver of 
turbulence and angular momentum transport in accretion disks and 
stellar interiors, but remains poorly understood. I will describe an 
investigation of MRI saturation using weakly nonlinear analysis, a 
perturbative treatment of the instability near threshold.
