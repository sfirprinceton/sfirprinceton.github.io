Maps of polarized thermal dust emission can be used to create extremely 
detailed “portraits” of magnetic field morphology, which can in turn be 
used to study the role of magnetic fields in star formation. The 
BLASTPol collaboration has recently released the most detailed magnetic 
field map ever made for a giant molecular cloud forming high mass 
stars.  Our 500 micron polarization map of Vela C has 0.5 pc resolution 
and covers almost all of the extent of this 10 by 30 pc cloud.  The 
intermediate and large-scale magnetic field in Vela C shows 
considerable order, however we also observe regions of large change in 
magnetic field orientation over small (~0.5 pc) scales.  These regions 
of high local dispersion in field orientation do not in general 
correlate with column density, as might be expected if the field were 
affected by large-scale gas motions near self gravitating cloud 
substructures.  I will show that empirical models of changes in 
polarization fraction across Vela C show considerable promise for 
probing the orientation of the magnetic field along the line of sight 
and characterizing the degree of disorder in the field.  The same 
methods can then be applied to synthetic polarization maps derived from 
3-D numerical simulations of star formation in order to constrain cloud 
magnetic field properties, though careful modeling of the dust 
temperature structure and grain alignment efficiency will be needed to 
fully understand the origin of variations in polarization fraction with 
column density.
