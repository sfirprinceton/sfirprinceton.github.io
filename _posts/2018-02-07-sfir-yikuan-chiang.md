Over the past few years, observations by Planck, WISE, Pan-STARRS and 
21cm radio surveys have been used to create a multitude of SFD-type 
Galactic dust maps. On a similar timescale, clustering-based redshift 
estimation has emerged as a new way to estimate redshifts and perform 
extragalactic tomography of arbitrary datasets. I will explain how 
clustering-based redshift estimation can be used to test the quality of 
the eight different dust maps currently available and I will show that 
extragalactic signatures can be revealed in many of them. When such 
maps are used for correcting optical magnitudes, we therefore expect 
biases which are likely to affect the precision of cosmological 
experiments using supernovae, BAOs, or the growth of structures. I will 
present possible solutions to alleviate this issue and discuss which 
map should be used depending on which measurement one wishes to make.
