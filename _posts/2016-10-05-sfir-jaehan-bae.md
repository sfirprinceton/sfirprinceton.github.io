The transport of angular momentum and mass, and the generation of 
turbulence play a crucial role in the evolution of a variety of 
astrophysical disks. Spiral waves, driven for instance by companion 
bodies or instabilities, have long been recognized as an important 
means responsible for the aforementioned two processes. I have recently 
come across an instability of spiral waves, which can significantly 
affect the capability of spiral waves transporting angular momentum and 
producing turbulence. The spiral wave instability (SWI) arises as 
inertial modes, natural oscillations in rotating systems, amplify as 
they resonantly couple to and extract energy from the background spiral 
waves. This leads to break down of the spiral waves into turbulence 
when the velocity perturbations by unstable inertial modes become of a 
similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral waves. Analyzing 
numerical results, I will show that the SWI can significantly affect 
the capability of spiral waves transporting angular momentum and 
producing turbulence. Implications to planet formation theories, 
observations of protoplanetary disks, and accretion processes in CV 
disks will be discussed.
