Mechanical feedback from AGN jets is a key process in galaxies and 
galaxy clusters: the energy input from the jets is crucial in 
determining the properties of the hot gas (especially in cool-core 
clusters), as well as inflating the large cavities we observe in xray 
gas. I will present the results of recent 3D numerical simulations of 
jets interacting with a hot gaseous halos around elliptical galaxies, 
and discuss the properties of the resulting “bubbles”. In particular, I 
will discuss “backflows” — i.e. large-scale gas circulation within a 
cavity pair — as means of self-regulation for the feedback. I will then 
proceed to discuss the effect of feedback from several jet episodes in 
simulations in a galaxy cluster environment, discuss the energetics of 
such system and show what we can learn from synthetic observations.
