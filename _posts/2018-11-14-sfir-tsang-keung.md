Stellar feedback is an indispensable component in galaxy evolution, 
which regulates star formation, drive galactic winds, and shape the 
galaxy structures. With the “Feedback in Realistic Environment’’ (FIRE) 
simulations, I demonstrate the importance of stellar feedback with a 
few examples: 1. how stellar feedback modifies the underlying dark 
matter halo structures, 2. how stellar feedback produces diffuse dwarf 
galaxies, e.g. ultra diffuse galaxies. In the second part of my talk, I 
will focus on an important kind of stellar feedback — cosmic ray (CR) 
feedback, which we have recently implemented in the code GIZMO and 
coupled to the FIRE stellar feedback model. I will demonstrate its 
strong effects on galaxies, e.g. star formation, galactic wind, and 
circum-galactic medium, but the effects highly depend on the CR 
propagation model. I will then show how to constrain those models by 
comparing our simulations with the observed gamma ray emission. 
Finally, I will discuss the ongoing research and future direction on CR 
feedback.
