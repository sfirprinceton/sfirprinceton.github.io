The UV photons emitted by newborn massive stars create a hostile 
environment for star formation. In particular, feedback from H II 
regions is believed to play a dominant role in expelling residual gas 
from star-forming clouds and hence in limiting the efficiency of star 
formation. In this talk, we present numerical simulations of star 
cluster formation in turbulent molecular clouds including the effects 
of photoionization and radiation pressure. To solve the radiative 
transfer equation around multiple point sources, we implement a highly 
efficient adaptive ray tracing module in Athena, adopting a completely 
asynchronous parallel algorithm. We find that photoevaporation is the 
primary mass loss mechanism for typical giant molecular clouds with net 
SF efficiency of ~10%, while radiation pressure is more important in 
dense massive clouds with higher efficiency. We make comparison of 
radiation force calculated with adaptive ray tracing and M1 closure, 
and also briefly discuss the potential use of adaptive ray tracer in 
future studies.
