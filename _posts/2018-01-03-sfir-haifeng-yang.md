Polarized (sub)millimeter emission from dust grains has long been 
established as a reliable way to probe magnetic fields, which are known 
to be very important in the formation and evolution of stars and 
protoplanetary disks. However, the first spatially resolved 
polarization observations of the protoplanetary disk HL Tau revealed a 
dust polarization pattern that, if interpreted as originating from 
magnetically-aligned dust grains, yielded a completely unphysical 
magnetic field configuration. This result was very surprising and left 
us with an outstanding question: what is the origin of (sub)millimeter 
disk polarization? My work has centered on exploring the 
“self-scattering” of dust grains as a promising answer to this 
question, and one that has successfully explained many of ALMA disk 
polarization observations made to date. On the pessimistic front, this 
new interpretation means that it is very difficult to probe magnetic 
fields using only (sub)millimeter disk polarization, though we have 
found suggestive evidence that the old interpretation may still be 
relevant for some systems. On the bright side, polarization arising 
from self-scattering depends strongly on various properties of the 
observed system — including grain size distribution, optical depth, and 
the thickness of the dust disks — and thus gives us observational 
access to many new and important topics, such as grain growth and dust 
settling.
