Young stars such as protostars and pre-main-sequence stars grow through 
the interaction with the surrounding disks. To reveal the accretion 
dynamics in the vicinity of the central stars, we have been developing 
a 3D MHD star-disk model using Athena++. We will show the results of 
global 3D MHD simulations of an accretion disk with a rotating, 
magnetized central star. The classical picture predicts that fast 
(~escape velocity) accretion onto the star is possible only when the 
star has a strong magnetosphere. However, we found that fast accretion 
can occur even without the magnetosphere, which seems to be consistent 
with recent observations of Herbig stars that are generally weakly 
magnetized. We are also investigating the origin of violent magnetic 
activity in the protostellar phase, protostellar flares. We will 
briefly discuss a possible occurrence mechanism and a connection to the 
dynamics in black hole accretion disks. Until recently there was only 
one group that succeeded in 3D modeling of accretion onto a central 
star. We will describe how previous pictures will be updated on the 
basis of our results.
