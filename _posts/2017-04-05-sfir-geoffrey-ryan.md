I will present numerical simulations of black hole accretion disks from 
the new moving mesh general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code 
GR-DISCO.  This open-source code uses an orbiting and shearing mesh 
which moves with the dominant flow velocity, greatly reducing numerical 
diffusion and increasing computational efficiency by allowing for a 
larger time step.  We have used GR-DISCO to study black hole accretion 
disks subject to gravitational torques from a binary companion, 
relevant for both current and future supermassive binary black hole 
searches and also as a possible electromagnetic precursor mechanism for 
LIGO events.  Binary torques in these discs excite spiral shockwaves 
which effectively transport angular momentum in the disc and propagate 
through the innermost stable circular orbit, leading to stress 
corresponding to an alpha-viscosity of the order 0.01 and a slight 
excess of high-energy emission over Novikov-Thorne disks.  I will 
discuss the advantages and challenges of a relativistic moving mesh 
code and show new 3D GRMHD calculations utilizing our constrained 
transport scheme.
