In this talk, I would like to introduce our semi-analytical formulation 
of the time-evolution equation for giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass 
functions in galactic disks. The computed time-evolutions based on this 
formulation show that the cloud-cloud collision effect is only limited 
in the massive end of mass profile. Our results suggest that measuring 
the power-law slope of GMC mass functions can be a powerful method to 
constrain GMC formation and dispersal timescales and gas resurrection 
processes in various galactic environments.
