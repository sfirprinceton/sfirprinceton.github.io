Wind-Roche-lobe-overflow (WRLOF) is a type of interaction in binary 
stars that is less intense than Roche-lobe-overflow and more intense 
than Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion. It is an effective way to 
transfer mass in relatively wide binaries as one of the stars ascend to 
asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) or red-giant-branch (RGB). We carried out 
3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with AstroBEAR to study WRLOF. In 
the simulations, we find some gas in the slow wind can be captured and 
accreted onto the secondary while the rest becomes outflow from the 
binary and carry away both mass and angular momentum. Meanwhile, 
circumbinary discs could form around the binary stars or spiral 
structure could be found. The mass transfer, outflow and tidal friction 
in close binaries could also change the dynamics of the binary stars. 
The orbital period may decay and the binary separation may also shrink. 
We find that the binary separation in some close binaries shrink 
rapidly and will finally lead to stronger binary interaction, such as 
common envelope and binary merger, within the lifetime of the giant 
star.
