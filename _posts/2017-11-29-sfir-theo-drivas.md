We obtain exact results for compressible turbulence with any equation 
of state, using coarse-graining/filtering. We find two mechanisms of 
turbulent kinetic energy dissipation: scale-local energy cascade and 
“pressure-work defect”, or pressure-work at viscous scales exceeding 
that in the inertial-range. Planar shocks in an ideal gas dissipate all 
kinetic energy by pressure-work defect, but the effect is omitted by 
standard LES modeling of pressure-dilatation. We also obtain a novel 
inverse cascade of thermodynamic entropy, injected by microscopic 
entropy production, cascaded upscale, and removed by large-scale 
cooling. This nonlinear process is missed by the Kovasznay linear mode 
decomposition, treating entropy as a passive scalar. For small Mach 
number we recover the incompressible “negentropy cascade” predicted by 
Obukhov. We derive exact Kolmogorov 4/5th-type laws for energy and 
entropy cascades, constraining scaling exponents of velocity, density, 
and internal energy to sub-Kolmogorov values. Although precise 
exponents and detailed physics are Mach-dependent, our exact results 
hold at all Mach numbers. Flow realizations at infinite Reynolds are 
“dissipative weak solutions” of compressible Euler equations, similarly 
as Onsager proposed for incompressible turbulence.  This is joint work 
with Gregory L. Eyink.
