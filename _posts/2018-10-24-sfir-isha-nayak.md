The Large Magellanic Cloud has been the subject of star formation 
studies for decades due to its proximity to the Milky Way (50 kpc), a 
nearly face-on orientation, and a low metallicity (0.5 solar) similar 
to that of galaxies at the peak of star formation in the universe 
(z~2). My work is on three extreme star forming environments in the 
Large Magellanic Cloud: 30 Doradus, N159, and N79. I analyze the CO 
molecular gas clouds, as well as other high density gas tracers, 
observed with ALMA to relate the star formation activity in 30 Doradus, 
N159, and N79 to the parental gas in which protostars form. I find that 
not all massive young stellar objects are associated with CO gas, 
higher mass clumps tend to form higher mass stars, and there is a 
density threshold above which massive star formation takes place. 
Looking at the interplay between dense molecular gas and the newly 
forming stars in a stellar nursery will shed light on how these stars 
formed: filamentary collision, monolithic collapse, or competitive 
accretion. My current work using ALMA observations of a super star 
cluster candidate in N79 serves as the basis for JWST MIRI and NIRCam 
planned GTO observations.
