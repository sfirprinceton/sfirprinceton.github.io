Turbulence is ubiquitous in all astrophysical plasmas with the 
turbulent power injected on large astrophysical scales, which is ~100 
pc in the interstellar medium. In contrast, the diffusion processes 
associated with microphysical plasma effects, such as ion-neutral 
collisional damping (ambipolar diffusion) in a partially ionized 
plasma, become important on small scales. Just as Gulliver’s travels 
from Lilliput to Brobdingnag, the magnetic field, born as a micro-scale 
and weak seed field, evolves to a large-scale and strong magnetic field 
as observed in the present-day Universe. Through this dynamo process, 
turbulent fluids become magnetized, whose dynamics and properties are 
substantially modified, and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description is 
required. In this talk, I will discuss our theoretical work on the 
nonlinear turbulent dynamo and the resulting MHD turbulence in a 
partially ionized plasma. I will also briefly discuss the implications 
of our results on, e.g., primordial star formation, structure formation 
in molecular clouds, a new method of measuring magnetic field strength 
in molecular clouds, and cosmic ray propagation in the partially 
ionized interstellar medium.
