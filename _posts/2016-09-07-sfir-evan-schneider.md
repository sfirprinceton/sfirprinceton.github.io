Galactic winds are a ubiquitous feature of rapidly star-forming 
galaxies. Observations have revealed these outflows to be complex, 
multiphase phenomena, with gas at a large range of densities and 
temperatures traveling at speeds from a few tens to more than 1000 
kilometers per second. Understanding how these outflows originate, 
evolve, and affect the circumgalactic medium and gas supply of galaxies 
is an important challenge for theories of galaxy evolution. In this 
talk, I will discuss how we are using a new hydrodynamics code, Cholla, 
to improve our understanding of galactic winds. Cholla is a massively 
parallel, GPU-based code that I wrote to take advantage of the newest 
generation of supercomputers. With Cholla, we can perform large, 
three-dimensional simulations of multiphase outflows, allowing us to 
track the coupling of mass and momentum between gas phases across 
hundreds of parsecs at sub-parsec resolution. The results of our recent 
simulations demonstrate that the evolution of cool gas in galactic 
winds is highly dependent on the initial structure of embedded clouds. 
In particular, we find that turbulent density structures lead to more 
efficient mass transfer from cool to hot phases of the wind. I will 
discuss the implications of our results both for the incorporation of 
winds into cosmological simulations, and for interpretations of 
observed multiphase winds and the circumgalatic medium of nearby 
galaxies.
