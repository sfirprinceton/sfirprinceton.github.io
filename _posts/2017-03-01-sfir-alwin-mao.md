Supernovae are copious producers of cosmic rays in the galaxy, which 
leads to a significant cosmic ray pressure. As these cosmic rays stream 
out of the galactic plane, they form pressure gradients which couple to 
gas through magnetic fields, driving mass loss. We study a simplified 
semi-analytic model for 1-D steady state cosmic-ray driven winds, find 
analytic scaling relations, and show that cosmic ray driven winds can 
produce significant mass loss comparable to the star formation rate.
